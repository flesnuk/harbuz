# Harbuz :watermelon:

```shell
npm install
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
### What I learned
- Use of services with Subject/Observable pattern
- Basic routing in angular
- Basic use of Typescript classes and enums
- Configure travis-ci and coverall for tests coverage
- Basic Jasmine tests
- Workaround for [iterating the keys of a map](https://github.com/flesnuk/harbuz/blob/8272736d595957b9dccc4d60b001ebac53e81839/src/app/ingredients/ingredients.component.ts#L33) in a component template until finding a better solution

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
